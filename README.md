# Who am I
Hello everyone!<br/>
My name is Daniele. I'm from Italy and I study electronics engineering at Politecnico di Milano.
I'm interested in electronics, computer science and music!

My journey with software began in the first year of high school when I first learnt about microprocessors.
So, I initially taught myself a bit of C/C++, just enough to start working with Arduino.
After a while, I started enjoying more and more just the programming side.<br/>
Nowadays, I mainly use Python to automate stuff, but I also have basic knowledge of other programming languages.<br/>
Less than a year ago, one of my friends introduced me to the wonderful world of Linux.
I'm still learning it, but I'm having a lot of fun working with the terminal!<br/>

I don't consider myself an expert in anything I mentioned.
I'm just a simple user who loves nosing around and trying to understand how things work!<br/>

Happy learning, everyone!
